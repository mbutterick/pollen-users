# pollen-users

This is the official discussion area / mailing-list substitute for Pollen, a book-publishing system written in Racket. 

Questions, suggestions, announcements welcome. Your host: Matthew Butterick.

This supersedes the `pollenpub` Google Group that was used from June 2015 – August 2019.

### To read

No login necessary. All activity happens under the [Issues](https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen-users/issues) tab.

### To post

You need a GitHub account (free; email address needed).


### What kinds of topics can be posted here?

Anything pertaining to using Pollen — questions, suggestions, feature requests, etc.


### To receive email notification of responses

If you start a new topic or add a response, you’ll automatically get email notification of subsequent messages posted to that thread.

### To receive email notification of new topics as they are created

That is, in the classic mailing-list style. At the top of the screen, use the “Watch” button to change your status to “Watching”.


### Does this replace the Pollen source repository?

No. That remains at https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen.


### Should I post Pollen bugs here or there?

Probably over there, though I’m not going to be finicky about it.


### Why not have all the discussion threads over there?

I prefer to restrict the issues in the Pollen source repository to coding-related tasks.
